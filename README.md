  Parsify believes in the phrase **YOLO**. You only live once, so make your code beautiful.

# Table Of Contents

# Generics

  This section applies to any language we write or work with, simply generic rules we **must** follow.
  It's a hard pill to swallow, being so rigid in our ideals, the reason for this is to have consistency.
  Principals. Morals. You know, those things that build character, our code has character, lets keep it 
  sane.

## Spacing

  `2` Space, no tabs. 

### Excuses and Philosophies

  Two spaces will look the same in every editor, regardless of what you use.

  **Excuse** Maximises usage of limited whitespace, not everyone has a large monitor, some of us work on laptops.

## Newlines

  **Don't** be afraid of newlines. 
  Break where needed, but logically.

  On the other side of the fence: ( _Makes sense if you view the source_ )

  **Don't** be afraid of long lines. Break where needed, and logically.

## Licensing

  **Open-source:** Apache, BSD, MIT, or AOL
